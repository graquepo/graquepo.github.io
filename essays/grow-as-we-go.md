Cotton is a horror-esque text-based adventure game I developed using the functions and macros built from The Wizard's Game in [Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/). Slightly more interesting and convoluted! (It is not that scary.)

To give you a flavor of the game, here is an excerpt from one run:

New Seed Discovered

Growing up, I have always looked up to my dad for being a Civil Engineer. I wanted to follow his footsteps and become an engineer just like him. When I learned that Computer Engineering existed, I did my research and I was drawn towards becoming one. My interest in software engineering sparked when I heard that my high school was opening up a Coding class. Since I enjoyed playing video games, math, and computers, I immediately took the opportunity and joined that class to learn more about the subject that is closely related to my interests. 

I did not know much about coding back in high school, and the first few days of that class was a struggle. We were learning CSS, HTML, and a little bit of Javascript. At the end of the year, we had to create a website from scratch with a group. I was able to enjoy that class, and I am glad I took the opportunity to start learning coding early. 

Blooming 

As I went on to college, I continued to pursue my goal of becoming a Computer Engineer/Software Engineer. I learned C/C++ and Python during my first three years of college, and in this class I was able to learn JavaScript. I did not expect myself to learn JavaScript in just a couple of hours. I think it is because all the other languages are similar to each other. They just have different structures and there are certain rules that are breakable in other languages. JavaScript seems more straightforward and easier to learn than the other programming languages (or maybe it’s because I already knew the basics from the other languages). 

Continuing Growth

I am excited to move forward into the class to learn more about JavaScript, UI Design, Meteor, etc. I am specifically looking forward to the end of the year project of creating a website with a team. I think I will enjoy creating the project. It will be interesting to compare the website I made in highschool, and see how much I improved. 

I hope that I am able to significantly improve my programming skills during my time in this class. I was never good at doing my work under short time constraints, so doing the WoDs in class will be interesting and challenging for me. I will have to practice a lot in order to successfully complete the WoDs. I hope that the skills I’ll learn in this class will help me when I step into the engineering working field.
