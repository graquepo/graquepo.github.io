Javascript can you jump off a cliff?

I was introduced to Javascript back in high school when I was still a complete newbie at coding. It was a struggle learning that as my first language, but I’m glad I learned it because now I am able to grasp into learning other languages easily. After coming back into Javascript after about 6 years of putting it aside, I would say that it is easier to learn, and it is more straightforward than the other languages I’ve learned. It might have also been easy for me to learn because I already knew the basics of other languages. I would say that Javascript is more simplified and relaxed. We do not need to worry about dealing with different return types. From a different perspective, if I tell Javascript to jump off a cliff, it would simply do so, but if I tell C to jump off a cliff, it would give me an error and say I can’t do that. 

While I was doing the Javascript introduction course, I was able to understand and learn it pretty fast. But while I was learning the ES6 module, it took me a little longer to do. 

Javascript is chill on the road

I believe Javascript is a great language to learn for someone who just started learning how to code. It has a lot of built in functions that would not need to be coded. Unlike C/C++, other variables such as integers could be transformed into a string. It’s still hard to say if Javascript is a good or bad language after only coding it for a few hours, but I would also say it has its drawbacks. Since Javascript almost lets you do whatever you want, and it has its easy going style, you might easily slide through the cracks and create wrong code. 

A Challenge Ahead

I think the practice WODs is definitely going to be useful for me because I do not do well in a timed environment, especially with coding. I take a very long time to do coding assignments, and I believe that I would need more practice than usual in order to successfully complete a WOD in class. I would have to go to every practice WODs with the TA and do my own WODs. The learning style for this class is definitely new for me. I’m not quite sure if I like it yet because I expected myself to learn coding during class. I do think it is a lot of work and we are given a very short amount of time for each of the assignments, and while also doing our other class homeworks. I think this class will be a challenge for me, but I will put in my effort and time to do my work, because I know that it will help me in my future job.
