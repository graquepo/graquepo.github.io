<p>My idea for this science project was to create power using recycled materials more-so from soda cans, and copper wires. I created this because I wanted to reduce waste anywhere in the world, and specifically ocean waste. This could also reduce power bills, and create a better environment. I tested to see if salinity affected water waste by creating a soda can battery. I had a soda can that was cut open on the top, and I had sand, a copper wire in the middle, and salt water inside. I tested to see how much voltage was produced from the soda can battery, and it only produced a small amount of voltage. The idea was there, and it could benefit our environment by decreasing pollution and waste, especially from fossil fuels and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>This project was individual so I pretty much did everything, from research to creating the experiment.I tested, analyzed, and observed. I also presented the project at my school, and it was a pretty nerve wracking and fun experience.</p>

<p>I was able to gain a lot of knowledge about how batteries work, understand where power comes from, and how the power we use today affects our environment negatively. This project was definitely a great experience for me, and I was able to build up my presentation skills. At first, I was really nervous about presenting, especially to teachers and to the college of engineering faculty, but I am glad I had this experience.</p>
